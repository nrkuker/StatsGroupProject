# QUESTION 2  ##########
#The data science group at Capital bike share hypothesize that:
#a. There must be high demand during office timings:
#Early morning and late evening can have different trend (cyclist) and low demand during 10:00pm to 4:00am. 
#Do you agree? 
#b. Registered users demand more bike on weekdays compared to the weekend or holiday. Do you agree?

#Create map of hourly demand to time of day windows
TOD <- read.csv("data/TOD.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble()
names(TOD)[names(TOD) == "Ã¯..Hour"] <- "Hour"

#Create clean dataset for hourly demand
Hypothesis <- select(bikes, Hour = hr, Weekday = weekday, Holiday = holiday, Workingday = workingday, 
         Casual = casual, Registered = registered, Total = cnt)

#Create mean of hourly demand for day
Avg_DayDemand <- mean(Day$Total)

#Create subset of hourly demand for office peak
Office <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Office")

Avg_OfficeDemand <- mean(Office$Total)

#Create subset of hourly demand for night
Night <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Night")

#Create subset of hourly demand for day trough
Trough <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Trough")

# Create subset of demand during commute times
Commute <- Hypothesis %>%

# THOUGHTS ####
# Demand differs significantly between workdays & nonworkdays
  # Registered demand is significantly more on workdays
  # Casual demand is significantly less on workdays
  # This trend holds except for looking at "noncommute" hours & nighttime hours:
    # Registered demand is significantly less during noncommuting hours on workdays
    # Registered demand is significantly less during nighttime on workdays

# Hierarchy of mean demand:
  # Commuting times > Office hours > Daytime hours > Non-commuting office hours > Avg of entire dataset > Trough window > Nighttime hours
