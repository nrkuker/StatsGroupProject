# QUESTION 2  ##########
#The data science group at Capital bike share hypothesize that:
#a. There must be high demand during office timings:
#Early morning and late evening can have different trend (cyclist) and low demand during 10:00pm to 4:00am. 
#Do you agree? 
#b. Registered users demand more bike on weekdays compared to the weekend or holiday. Do you agree?

#Create map of hourly demand to time of day windows
TOD <- read.csv("data/TOD.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble()
names(TOD)[names(TOD) == "Ã¯..Hour"] <- "Hour"

#Create clean dataset for hourly demand
Hypothesis <- select(bikes, Hour = hr, Weekday = weekday, Holiday = holiday, Workingday = workingday, 
         Casual = casual, Registered = registered, Total = cnt) 

Hypothesis <- left_join(Hypothesis, TOD, by = "Hour")

#Create subset of hourly demand for day-time
Day_Demand <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(Window == "Day")

#Create mean of hourly demand for day
Avg_DayDemand <- mean(Day_Demand$Total)

#Create subset of hourly demand for office peak
Office <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Office")

Avg_OfficeDemand <- mean(Office$Total)

#Create subset of hourly demand for night
Night <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Night")

#Create subset of hourly demand for day trough
Trough <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Trough")

Trough_Demand <- mean(Trough$Total)

# Create subset of demand during commute times
Commute <- Hypothesis %>% 
  filter(Commute == 1)

Noncommute <- Hypothesis %>% 
  filter(Commute == 0, TOD == "Office")



# DAY TIME ####

#Null hypothesis: Office Peak Demand >= Total Demand

#Test whether office peak demand is greater than total demand
t.test(Office$Total, mu=Avg_DayDemand, alternative="two.sided")

#Conclusion: accept the null as p-value is greater than alpha 0.05



# NK EDIT:

# H0: avg demand during daylight == avg demand over entire day
# Ha: avg demand during daylight != 

t.test(Day_Demand$Total, 
       mu = mean(Hypothesis$Total, na.rm = T), 
      alternative = "two.sided")

t.test(Office$Total, 
       mu = mean(Day_Demand$Total, na.rm = T), 
       alternative = "two.sided")
# reject null, at alpha 0.05 and 0.01
# 95% CI for avg demand during office hours is [283.0607, 291.2821], x-bar = 287.1714
# entire 95% CI above avg demand during daylight












# NIGHT TIME ####

#Null hypothesis: Night Demand <= Total Demand

#Test whether night demand is less than total demand
t.test(Night$Total, mu=Avg_DayDemand, alternative="greater")

#Conclusion: accept the null as p-value is greater than alpha 0.05


# NK edits:

# H0: avg demand during nighttime == avg demand over entire day
# Ha: avg demand during nighttime !=

t.test(Night$Total, 
       mu = mean(Hypothesis$Total, na.rm = T), 
       alternative = "two.sided")
# absolutely reject null

#Null hypothesis: Office Peak Demand >= Total Demand
