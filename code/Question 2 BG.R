# QUESTION 2  ##########
#The data science group at Capital bike share hypothesize that:
#a. There must be high demand during office timings:
#Early morning and late evening can have different trend (cyclist) and low demand during 10:00pm to 4:00am. 
#Do you agree? 
#b. Registered users demand more bike on weekdays compared to the weekend or holiday. Do you agree?

#Create map of hourly demand to time of day windows
TOD <- read.csv("data/TOD.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble()
names(TOD)[names(TOD) == "Ã¯..Hour"] <- "Hour"

#Create clean dataset for hourly demand
Hypothesis <- select(bikes, Hour = hr, Weekday = weekday, Holiday = holiday, Workingday = workingday, 
         Casual = casual, Registered = registered, Total = cnt) 

Hypothesis <- left_join(Hypothesis, TOD, by = "Hour")

#Create summary of hourly demand by TOD
Demand_Sum <- Hypothesis %>%
  group_by(TOD) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Demand = mean(Total), .groups = 'drop')
