# QUESTION 2  ##########
#The data science group at Capital bike share hypothesize that:
#a. There must be high demand during office timings:
#Early morning and late evening can have different trend (cyclist) and low demand during 10:00pm to 4:00am. 
#Do you agree? 
#b. Registered users demand more bike on weekdays compared to the weekend or holiday. Do you agree?

#Create map of hourly demand to time of day windows
TOD <- read.csv("data/TOD.csv") %>% 
  as_tibble()
names(TOD)[names(TOD) == "Ã¯..Hour"] <- "Hour"

#Create clean dataset for hourly demand
Hypothesis <- select(bikes, Hour = hr, Weekday = weekday, Holiday = holiday, Workingday = workingday, 
         Casual = casual, Registered = registered, Total = cnt) 

Hypothesis <- left_join(Hypothesis, TOD, by = "Hour")

#Create subset of hourly demand for day-time
Day_Demand <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(Window == "Day")

#Create mean of hourly demand for day
Avg_DayDemand <- mean(Day_Demand$Total)

#Create subset of hourly demand for office peak
Office <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Office")

#Null hypothesis: Office Peak Demand >= Total Day Demand

#Test whether office peak demand is greater than total demand
t.test(Office$Total, mu=Avg_DayDemand, alternative="less")

#Conclusion: accept the null as p-value is greater than alpha 0.05

#Create subset of hourly demand for night
Night <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Night")

#Null hypothesis: Night Demand <= Total Demand

#Test whether night demand is less than total demand
t.test(Night$Total, mu=Avg_DayDemand, alternative="greater")

#Conclusion: accept the null as p-value is greater than alpha 0.05

# Trough vs Peak #####

#Create subset of hourly demand for day trough
Trough <- Hypothesis %>%
  filter(TOD == "Trough")

Trough_Demand <- mean(Trough$Total)

#Null hypothesis: Office Peak Demand >= Trough Demand

#Test whether office peak demand is greater than trough demand
t.test(Office$Total, mu=Trough_Demand, alternative="less")

# Commute versus Midday #####


# Scatterplot for demand across the day #####
Hypothesis_2 <- Hypothesis %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Dmd = mean(Total))

ggplot(Hypothesis_2, aes(x = Hour,
                         y = Avg_Dmd)) +
